# Arc PAYG vs. SPLA Estimator

A static GitHub Pages estimator for comparing the economics of Azure Arc
pay-as-you-go licensing and SPLA for SQL Server and Windows Server workloads.

The estimator is self-contained in `site/index.html`. Distributor Azure PAYG
prices for all supported currencies are embedded in that file so the published
site loads without making a pricing API request. Distributor SPLA list prices,
reseller SPLA prices, and reseller Azure PAYG prices remain user-provided. The
SQL and Windows comparisons use the reseller prices. The distributor business
case compares those revenues with distributor SPLA list costs and embedded Azure
costs after the fixed 15% PEC discount. PEC is not deducted from reseller Azure
revenue in the distributor business case. User-provided prices persist in
browser storage and exported project JSON files, but are never embedded in a
hosted or offline HTML copy. Project names and configured workloads are retained
only in exported project JSON files.

Exported project JSON contains one top-level `currency` field directly after
`projectName`. Currency is not duplicated in the SQL and Windows calculation
sections. Imports remain compatible with older project files that store the
same currency in both calculation sections.

New exports use `hasSplaIncentives` and descriptive product keys such as
`sqlServerStandardSpla`, `sqlServerEnterprisePayg`, and
`windowsServerDatacenterPayg`. Imports also accept the legacy `hasSpla`,
`spla1`/`spla2`, and `payg1`/`payg2` keys.

DCO is configured once at the distributor level and applies to both reseller
calculations. Its default incentive rate is 12%. The reseller impact includes a
DCO component only when pass-along is enabled and the configured share is
greater than zero. The distributor business case includes the retained DCO
share. Its SPLA incentive, MCI Core, and MCI Growth Accelerator defaults are 5%,
3%, and 12%, respectively. A highlighted economic-impact growth result compares
Azure PAYG with SPLA total economic contribution using
`(Azure contribution - SPLA contribution) / |SPLA contribution| * 100`. The
result is unavailable when SPLA contribution is zero.

## Price refresh and deployment

The **Refresh estimator prices** GitHub Actions workflow:

- can be started manually from the repository's **Actions** tab;
- runs on the first day of every month at 12:00 AM Pacific time, accounting for
  both PST and PDT;
- fetches current SQL Server and Windows Server Arc PAYG prices from the
  [Azure Retail Prices API](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/cost-management/retail-prices/azure-retail-prices);
- updates the embedded price map and ISO refresh timestamp in `site/index.html`;
- commits the refreshed estimator to `main`.

The successful refresh workflow triggers **Deploy estimator to GitHub
Pages**. Pushes to `main` and manual workflow dispatches also deploy the current
contents of `site/`.

## Project layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `site/index.html` | Self-contained estimator published to GitHub Pages |
| `site/pricing.js` | Azure Retail Prices API fetch and filtering helper |
| `scripts/fetch-prices.js` | Updates prices and refresh time embedded in the estimator |
| `.github/workflows/refresh-prices.yml` | Refreshes pricing monthly or manually |
| `.github/workflows/pages.yml` | Tests and deploys `site/` to GitHub Pages |

## Setup

1. In **Settings > Pages**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
2. In **Settings > Actions > General**, allow workflows read and write
   permissions so the refresh workflow can commit updated prices.
3. Run **Refresh estimator prices** from the **Actions** tab once, or refresh
   locally with `npm run fetch-prices`.
4. Push to `main`, or manually run **Deploy estimator to GitHub Pages**.

## Development

Node.js 20 or later is recommended. There are no package dependencies.

```sh
npm test
npm run fetch-prices
python -m http.server --directory site 8000
```
